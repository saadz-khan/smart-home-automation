# IOT Module Code
__Code in the complete-iot.ino file is relevant for the ESP-8266 Wi-Fi Arduino Module.__  
We created a basic HTML code for making an IP-based web page with buttons that control the devices connected to module stated above.  
* LED Control
* Servo Motor Control with degree of rotation.  
## Changes Made to the Code
Change the SSID and Password in the code (ref line 4, 5) by the username and password of the Wi-Fi currently in your use.
